Upstream-Status: Inapproriate

Remove flag for DSE MemorySSA as it is a feature available in the
newest clang llvm revisions. Not all the yocto releases use the newest
one. Otherwise, clang will complain about unknown command line argument.
This should be revisited when our supported yocto branches have newer
clang version.
