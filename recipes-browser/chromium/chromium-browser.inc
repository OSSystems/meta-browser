# Recipe files have to perform the following tasks after including this file:
# 1) Add patches to SRC_URI. Platform-specific patches should be contained in
#    either "chromium-x11" or "chromium-wayland". There are also patches that
#    are shared amongst platforms but may one day no longer be needed. These
#    do not belong in such a subdirectory, but still need to be explicitely be
#    added. Do NOT add ozone-wayland patches to SRC_URI here!
# 2) Add md5sum and sha256sum hashes of the tarball.
# 3) Add ozone-wayland patches to the OZONE_WAYLAND_EXTRA_PATCHES variable.
# 4) Set the OZONE_WAYLAND_GIT_BRANCH and OZONE_WAYLAND_GIT_SRCREV values.
# 5) Optionally, set values for these variables:
#    * OZONE_WAYLAND_PATCH_FILE_GLOB
#    * OZONE_WAYLAND_GIT_DESTSUFFIX
#    * CHROMIUM_X11_GYP_DEFINES
#    * CHROMIUM_WAYLAND_GYP_DEFINES

# PACKAGECONFIG options
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# * use-egl: (on by default)
#       Without this packageconfig, the Chromium build will use GLX for
#       creating an OpenGL context in X11, and regular OpenGL for painting
#       operations. Neither are desirable on embedded platforms. With this
#       packageconfig, EGL and OpenGL ES 2.x are used instead.
#
# * disable-api-keys-info-bar: (off by default)
#       This disables the info bar that warns: "Google API keys are missing".
#       With some builds, missing API keys are considered OK, so the bar needs
#       to go. Conversely, if Chromium is compiled with this option off and
#       the user wishes to disable the warning, the following lines can be
#       added to the "google-chrome" script (see patchset) before the
#       chromium binary is called:
#           export GOOGLE_API_KEY="no"
#           export GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID="no"
#           export GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET="no"
#
# * component-build: (off by default)
#       Enables component build mode. By default, all of Chromium (with the
#       exception of FFmpeg) is linked into one big binary. The linker step
#       requires at least 8 GB RAM. Component mode was created to facilitate
#       development and testing, since with it, there is not one big binary;
#       instead, each component is linked to a separate shared object. Use
#       component mode for development, testing, and in case the build machine
#       is not a 64-bit one, or has less than 8 GB RAM.
#
# * ignore-lost-context: (off by default)
#       There is a flaw in the HTML Canvas specification. When the canvas'
#       backing store is some kind of hardware resource like an OpenGL
#       texture, this resource might get lost. In case of OpenGL textures,
#       this happens when the OpenGL context gets lost. The canvas should then
#       be repainted, but nothing in the Canvas standard reflects that. This
#       packageconfig is to be used if the underlying OpenGL (ES) drivers do
#       not lose the context, or if losing the context is considered okay
#       (note that canvas contents can vanish then).
#
# * impl-side-painting: (off by default)
#       This is a new painting mechanism. Still in
#       development stages, it can improve performance See
#       http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/impl-side-painting
#       for more.
#
# * kiosk-mode: (off by default)
#       Enable this option if you want your browser to start up full-screen,
#       without any menu bars, without any clutter, and without any initial
#       start-up indicators.
#
# * proprietary-codecs: (off by default)
#       Enable this option if you want to add support for additional proprietary
#       codecs, most notably MPEG standards (h.264, h.265, MP4, MP3, AAC, MPEG-2 ..)
