Subject: [PATCH] rust - don't abort on panic

The Rust in Yocto needs to be compiled in a special way (with RUST_PANIC_STRATEGY = "abort"
in local.conf) to make abort-on-panic work. Otherwise it fails with the following error:

error: the crate `panic_abort` does not have the panic strategy `abort`

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [oe-specific]
