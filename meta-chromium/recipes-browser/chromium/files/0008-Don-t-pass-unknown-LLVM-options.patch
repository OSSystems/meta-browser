Subject: [PATCH] Don't pass unknown LLVM options

Because we compile and link with an older LLVM version than upstream, we
need to drop the following LLVM options that aren't available yet:
* disable-auto-upgrade-debug-info
* split-threshold-for-reg-with-hint

Trying to pass them anyways will lead to an "Unknown command line
argument" error.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [specific to older versions of LLVM]
