Subject: [PATCH 10/11] Don't require profiler_builtins.rlib

This library is only needed for profiling builds, which we don't do.
Including it leads to compile errors on with OE's current master branch
because they disabled building the library, so just skip it.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [specific to our build setup]
