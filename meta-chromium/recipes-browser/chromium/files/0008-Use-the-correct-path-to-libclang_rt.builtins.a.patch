Subject: [PATCH] Use the correct path to libclang_rt.builtins.a

Chromium needs to link against libclang_rt.builtins.a, but it expects
it in a slightly different directory than where it actually is in our
sysroot. Thus, we need adjust the where Chromium looks for the library.

Note that the directory used by this patch is actually independent of
the target architecture. This has the added benefit that we can just
copy the target's libclang_rt.builtins.a to the host's sysroot (to the
same directory where the host's library is). This is necessary because
Chromium needs to link against this library for both host and target
code, but only allows us to specify a single `clang_base_path`.

Upstream-Status: Inappropriate [specific to our sysroot setup]
