# Ozone is default via finch since M94 and default via compile time
# changes since M95. However, use_x11 still must be disable to provide
# a pure Wayland build. Since M95, use_x11 is controlled via
# ozone_platform_x11 and won't be needed to be altered here, but rather
# through the mentioned ozone_platform_x11 arg.
# TODO(msisov): remove this once recipe is updated to M95.
