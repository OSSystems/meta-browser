This script can be used to generate LIC_FILES_CHKSUM in chromium.inc.

It uses Chromium's own tools/licenses.py script to scan for third_party
directories and license files. This means its output is generated on a
best-effort basis, as some directories are non-compliant upstream or may not be
found. It might also include directories which are not used in a
Yocto/OpenEmbedded build.
